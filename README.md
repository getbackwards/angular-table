# Test for UI (Angular/Typescript)

I have done most of this in HTML/CSS.

There are many fancier soultions to responsive tables such as:
[https://stackblitz.com/edit/material-table-responsive?file=tsconfig.json](https://stackblitz.com/edit/material-table-responsive?file=tsconfig.json), [Materialize Responsive Table](https://materializecss.com/table.html)
etc. I have implimented a simple solution, here's a [short video showing how it performs on mobile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FOQenfaD18&ab_channel=freakzombie).
